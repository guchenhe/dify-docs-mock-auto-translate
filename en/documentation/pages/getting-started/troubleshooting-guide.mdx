# Troubleshooting Your Dify Applications

This guide helps you diagnose and resolve common issues when building and deploying Dify applications.

## Common Issues

### API Connection Problems
**Symptoms:**
- Connection timeouts
- Authentication failures
- Rate limiting errors
- Network connectivity issues

**Solutions:**
- Verify API keys are correctly configured
- Check network connectivity and firewall settings
- Implement proper retry logic with exponential backoff
- Monitor rate limits and implement throttling

### Model Performance Issues
**Symptoms:**
- Slow response times
- Poor quality outputs
- Inconsistent results
- Memory usage spikes

**Solutions:**
- Optimize prompt engineering techniques
- Adjust model parameters (temperature, max tokens)
- Implement caching for frequently used queries
- Monitor and scale computational resources

### Data Processing Errors
**Symptoms:**
- File upload failures
- Data parsing errors
- Knowledge base indexing issues
- Search result inconsistencies

**Solutions:**
- Validate input data formats and sizes
- Check file permissions and storage quotas
- Rebuild knowledge base indices if corrupted
- Verify data preprocessing pipelines

## Debugging Tools

### Built-in Debugging
- Use Dify's debug console for real-time monitoring
- Enable detailed logging for error tracking
- Analyze conversation logs for pattern identification
- Monitor performance metrics and resource usage

### External Tools
- Browser developer tools for web applications
- API testing tools like Postman or curl
- Log aggregation services for centralized monitoring
- Performance profiling tools for optimization

### Testing Strategies
- Unit testing for individual components
- Integration testing for workflow validation

- User acceptance testing for experience validation

## Performance Optimization

### Response Time Optimization
- Implement efficient caching strategies
- Optimize database queries and indexing
- Use CDN for static asset delivery
- Consider edge computing for global users

### Resource Management
- Monitor memory usage patterns
- Implement proper connection pooling
- Configure auto-scaling policies
- Optimize container resource allocation

### Cost Optimization
- Monitor API usage and costs
- Implement usage quotas and alerts
- Optimize model selection for use cases
- Consider batch processing for bulk operations

## Deployment Issues

### Environment Configuration
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Check dependency versions and compatibility
- Validate SSL/TLS certificate configuration
- Ensure proper secret management

### Infrastructure Problems
- Monitor server health and availability
- Check load balancer configuration
- Verify DNS resolution and routing
- Validate backup and recovery procedures

### CI/CD Pipeline Issues
- Review deployment logs for errors
- Validate automated testing results
- Check rollback procedures work correctly
- Monitor post-deployment metrics
