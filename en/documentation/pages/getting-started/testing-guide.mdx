# Testing Your Dify Applications

Testing is crucial for ensuring your Dify applications work reliably. This guide covers testing strategies, tools, and best practices for AI applications.

## Types of Testing

### Functional Testing
- Test core application features
- Verify conversation flows  
- Validate API responses
- Check error handling

### Performance Testing
- Response time benchmarks
- Load testing under stress
- Memory usage monitoring
- API rate limit testing

### User Experience Testing
- Conversation quality assessment
- User interface testing
- Accessibility validation
- Mobile responsiveness

## Testing Strategies

### Automated Testing
Set up automated test suites:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for workflows
- End-to-end conversation testing
- API endpoint validation

### Manual Testing
Conduct regular manual testing:
- Exploratory testing sessions
- User journey validation
- Edge case identification
- Quality assurance reviews

### A/B Testing
Compare different approaches:
- Different prompt variations
- Model performance comparisons
- UI/UX alternatives
- Feature flag testing

## Testing Tools

### Built-in Testing Features
- Dify's Preview mode
- Debug console
- Conversation logs
- Performance metrics

### External Testing Tools

- Pytest for Python testing

## Best Practices

### Test Early and Often
- Test during development
- Continuous integration testing
- Regular regression testing
- Pre-deployment validation

### Comprehensive Coverage
- Test happy paths and edge cases
- Include error scenarios
- Validate all user inputs
- Test integration points

### Documentation
- Maintain test documentation
- Document known issues
- Track test coverage metrics
