# Workflow Automation Guide

This guide will help you understand and implement automated workflows in Dify.

## Overview

Workflow automation in Dify allows you to create sophisticated AI-powered processes that can handle complex tasks automatically.

## Key Features

### Visual Workflow Builder

Build workflows visually with our drag-and-drop interface:
- **Node-based design**: Connect different nodes to create complex flows
- **Real-time preview**: See your workflow in action as you build
- **Error handling**: Built-in error handling and retry mechanisms

### Supported Node Types

1. **Input Nodes**: Accept user input or API data
2. **Processing Nodes**: Transform and manipulate data
3. **LLM Nodes**: Integrate various language models
4. **Output Nodes**: Return results to users or systems

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Create a New Workflow

Navigate to the Workflows section and click "Create New Workflow".

### Step 2: Add Your First Node

Start with an input node to define what data your workflow will process.

### Step 3: Connect Processing Logic

Add processing nodes to transform your data as needed.

### Step 4: Test and Deploy

Use the preview feature to test your workflow before deploying to production.

## Best Practices

- **Keep workflows modular**: Break complex processes into smaller, reusable workflows
- **Handle errors gracefully**: Always include error handling nodes
- **Monitor performance**: Use built-in analytics to track workflow performance
- **Version control**: Save different versions of your workflows

## Advanced Features

### Conditional Logic

Use IF-ELSE nodes to create branching logic based on conditions.

### Loops and Iterations

Process arrays and collections with iteration nodes.

### External Integrations

Connect to external APIs and services through HTTP nodes.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Workflow not triggering**: Check your trigger conditions and permissions.

**Slow performance**: Optimize node configurations and reduce unnecessary processing.

**Data format errors**: Ensure data types match between connected nodes.
