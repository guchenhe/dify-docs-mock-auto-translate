# Migration Guide

Migrating from other platforms to Dify.

## From LangChain

If you're currently using LangChain, Dify provides a visual way to build similar workflows:

1. Map your chains to Dify workflow nodes
2. Configure LLM and tool integrations
3. Test and deploy

## From n8n

Dify complements n8n's workflow automation with AI-native capabilities:

- Use n8n for general automation
- Use Dify for AI-powered workflows
- Integrate both platforms via webhooks

## Best Practices

- Test migrations incrementally
- Validate outputs against your existing system
- Update documentation and team training
