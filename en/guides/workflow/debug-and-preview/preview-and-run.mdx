Test your workflow before publishing to catch issues early.

## Test individual nodes

When a specific node isn't working, click the debug icon in its top-right corner to test it individually. Start with simple input data and gradually make it more complex to see how the node responds.

## Test the full workflow

Use Preview to test your entire workflow from start to finish. This shows you the user interface exactly as users will see it, including input fields and output areas.

Before running, Dify automatically checks for missing parameters, broken connections, and other configuration issues.

While your workflow runs, you can see each node's status in the right panel. Green indicators mean success, and you'll see input/output data for each step.

## Check execution history

Click "Last Run" on any node to see logs from its most recent execution, including what data went in, what came out, how long it took, and any errors.

## Monitor live applications

After publishing, you can view logs to see how users interact with your application and troubleshoot any issues that come up.
